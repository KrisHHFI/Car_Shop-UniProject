### About

The app was created in 2022 during my second year at Haaga-Helia UAS, Helsinki. The theme is a fictional car shop platform, which uses data sourced from APIs. Users can view, edit and delete cars. None of users changes are permanent. Check out the [Personal Trainer App](https://github.com/KrisHHFI/Personal_Trainer_App) which I created after this project, it greatly expands upon this idea. The app was created using JavaScript, React, HTML, and it is ran within the users web browser.
